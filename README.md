-- Module3Project1.cpp : Program to display a 24hr and 12hr clock

  This project was created using C++. The objective was to create a simple clock display and then accuratley add seconds, minutes and hours to the display. It will keep the two clocks on the screen and refresh the display accordingly. If I was to improve this code I would find a way to automate it to become a fully functional clock that can still be set with user input. Due to this being my first major C++ project it was challenging to create the clock but also to create it within the guidlines provided by the scope of the assignment. It was my first attempt at writing comments more freely. I try to create understandable variable names in addition to comments to improve the readability of my code.
