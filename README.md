### Module3Project1.cpp : Program to display a 24hr and 12hr clock

  This project was created using C++. The objective was to create a simple clock display and then accuratley add seconds, minutes and hours to the display. It will keep the two clocks on the screen and refresh the display accordingly. If I was to improve this code I would find a way to automate it to become a fully functional clock that can still be set with user input. Due to this being my first major C++ project it was challenging to create the clock but also to create it within the guidlines provided by the scope of the assignment. It was my first attempt at writing comments more freely. I try to create understandable variable names in addition to comments to improve the readability of my code.

### Theoretical Software Design Document

  This document handles a theoretical scenario of providing software requirements to a client known as "The Gaming Room''. This client was seeking a web based software application to host their game. In developing this documentation there was a focus on clearly defining all the different avenues and operating system platforms that the client could take to publish and host their application. When developing code it was helpful to have the document to be able to define what IDE's and languages might need to be leveraged in order to host on the clients chosen platform. If I could choose a part of this document to revise at a later date I would focus more on the specific breakdown of each operating system and perhaps dedicate a number of pages specifically talking about each platform at a time.I would interpret the user’s needs and design suggestions that would need to managed in the form of user stories and sorted on some product backlog to ensure the higher priority user needs are implemented into the software. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because they are the end user of the application. If they do not find the application appealing to use they will no longer support the application financially. When it came to designing software the approach and strategies I used were to begin thinking of the design holistically. A big overview is necessary to understand the scope of the application. Then begin to break down the application piece by piece until they are components that can be developed. This is how I would design most similar software applications.
